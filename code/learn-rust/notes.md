# Rust notes

## Syntax

- pub -> public
- fn -> function
- no null like in order languages instead Option type & None

## functions

- no semicolon = return

## strings

- single quotes for char and double quotes for strings

## arrays

- arr fixed-sized, vec dynamic size

## conditions

- no parenthesis required in if-statements
- tenary operator is if else block (type-consistentcy)
- match instead of switch case
- if argument must be explicitly a bool

## possibilities

- create a new string with a an initial capacity allocation

### Macros functions: e.g println, assert_eq, format

- they all need (!) before brackets
- dynamic args inputs
- Compile-TIme Expansion: code is completed at compile-time to the final output with the different args and therefore no overhead during run-time,
